(1) FftSamplesTest.java
	JUnit program for testing (1) transformation of wav to integer (2) the filter for preemphesizing
	(3) windowning (Hann) (4) fft transformation.

(2) testResouce/lib/dsp.py
	A class file to calculate (1) transformation of wav to integer (2) the filter for preemphesizing
	(3) windowning (Hann) (4) fft transformation.

(3) testResouce/lib/snd/test1.wav
(4) testResouce/lib/snd/test2.wav
	Wav files used for testing.


(5) fft_samples.txt
	The results of fft transformation by using numpy library.

(6) int_samples
	The results of transformation of wav to integer.

(7) preemph_samples.txt
	The results of preemphaizing.

(8) test.py
	The script to output the (1) transformation of wav to integer (2) the filter for preemphesizing
	(3) windowning (Hann) (4) fft transformation.
	This script needs one argument: wav file name to calculate features.

(9) windowed_samples.txt
